This is a companion [web app](https://type-challenges.vercel.app/) for [Type challenges](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges)

## Motivation
Since the original repo does not provide a good way to track the progress, I made this to keep track of my progress while solving typescript challenges

## Features
- It uses local storage to keep track of your progress.
- Created with Next.js 14 & Tailwind CSS.
